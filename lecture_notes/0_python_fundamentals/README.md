# 0. Python fundamentals 

In this folder, you'll find jupyter notebooks on the fundamentals of Python. We won't go through these lecture notes in class, instead you can use them as reference materials. These are more comprehensive than the summaries that are covered in class. This is because you are expected to have fundamental programming concepts from other languages.
