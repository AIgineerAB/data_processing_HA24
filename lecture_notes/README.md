# Lecture notes :book:

The lecture notes are divided into 

0. python-fundamentals
1. python-summary
2. data-processing 

Note that the lecture notes are mostly in jupyter notebooks and are more comprehensive than the code-alongs. 

> Study tip: read and work through the lecture notes before the lecture, so that you are more prepared and can ask questions to the teacher.
