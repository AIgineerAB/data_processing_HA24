# Python :snake: and data processing :computer: (OPA23GB_AI 1)

This course aims to introduce fundamental concepts in python, data processing in pandas and data visualisation in matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. The data visualisation part will both cover **exploratory** data analysis and **explanatory** data analysis, where we will use data visualisation for data storytelling. Further, in the course we will also work with git, github for source control and poetry for virtual environment. A course in AI, data science and/or data engineering is a natural continuation after this course.

Although the course is a fundamental course, a large amount of concepts are covered in a short time and hence it's good to have some programming experience in other languages.
