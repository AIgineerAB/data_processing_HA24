# Week 10 - Resources

Focus for this week is KPIs, high performance pandas and data storytelling.

**KPI**


**Storytelling**
- [choose an effective visual - storytelling with data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/chart-guide)
- [what is a bar chart? - A. Velez (2020)](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/2/19/what-is-a-bar-chart)
- [what is a line graph? - M. Cisneros (2020)](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/3/24/what-is-a-line-graph)
- [storytelling with data - books](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books)
- [PrataData - K. Giang (2023)](https://github.com/kokchun/PrataData)
- [matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html#quick-start)

**High performance**

Some of these packages will be touched later on during the education, but mostly they are for reference when needed in your future work. However note that you should always consider readability, fast development. High performance should be considered when the situation requires it, so that it doesn't slow down the development.

## Lecture notes :mortar_board:

We'll learn how to connect data processing to business values through key performance indicators (KPIs), and how to make storytelling out of the data in order to impact business stakeholders.

- Lec2.5-2.7

## Exercises :running:

No exercises this week, either work with old exercises you have left or with the lab.

## Lab 2

Do lab 2, you will find the lab in your learning platform.
